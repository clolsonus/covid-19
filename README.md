# Daily plots

## May 19, 2020

Replaced Belgium (few new deaths) with Mexico (accelerating upwards.)
Mexico is on pace to exceed Iran's total number of deaths within a
week.

USA continues to it's glacial slowdown.

Looking off the end of the plot, Brazil is roughly on pace to pass all
countries other than the USA in 20 days (before mid-June.)  Wouldn't
it be a sad irony if the two of the countries with leaders that took
covid-19 the least seriously, ended up with the most deaths?

## May 18, 2020

Daily rate continues to drop in the USA, now close to 1300/day.  100k
mark is pushed back to May 26. Brazil will hit the 20k mark near May
21.

## May 16, 2020

Notice that Brazil is still accelerating the wrong way (and they have
a president that really doesn't think covid is a big deal.)

## May 14, 2020

Under 1500 deaths per day now in the USA.

100k mark slips to May 25.

## May 11, 2020

The pace continues to ease slightly in the USA.

## May 10, 2020

Today is mothers day in the USA.

![poly](figures/20200510.png?raw=true "10 May, 2020")

## May 9, 2020

USA continues to trend down, but only by the slightest amounts.  The 100k
mark shows up around May 24.

![poly](figures/20200509.png?raw=true "9 May, 2020")

## May 8, 2020

For the USA, we stay flat, the 2nd order polynomial continues to be a
good fit to the existing data.

![poly](figures/20200508.png?raw=true "8 May, 2020")

## May 7, 2020

For the USA, we continue pretty flat on a pace around 1700 deaths per
day.

## May 6, 2020

The big change for today is a switch from a linear fit model to a 2nd
degree polynomial fit.  We have to be extremely careful extrapolating
with polynomials, but the curve is flat enough over the fit time span
that it actually works very well.  I believe for this time period the
predictive results are better than a logistic function.

Note this new fit pushes the 100k mark out beyond the end of the
graph.  Professional model estimates have been pushing upwards (a lot)
in the past few days,finally acknowledging the USA as a whole is not
on a rapid down trajetory and no near term end is in site.

## May 5, 2020

UK passes Italy.  Most of the big European countries are coming in
below the linear prediction, possibly moving towards a logistic
function being a better fit.  Brazil numbers are taking off.  US pace
might be dropping slightly, but only slightly ... or this could be a
weekend ebb in reporting.

![linear](figures/20200505.png?raw=true "5 May, 2020")

## May 4, 2020

The past two days have been down (yeah!)  Let's hope the trend
continues and breaks the linear fit!  The 100k mark is looming out
there around May 20 at the current rate.

## May 3, 2020

A noticable dip in the data for today.

## Apr 26, 2020

Notice on this day the model predicted the 80k mark would be reached
on May 9.  Scroll up to May 6 and see that the prediction and progress
has been spot on (plus/minus 1 day.)

![linear](figures/20200426.png?raw=true "26 Apr, 2020")

## Sometime in early April (2020) the USA death toll became quite linear, and thus a linear fit/predictor became the best model of our behavior available for near term expecations (at least for the upcoming 7-14 days.)
