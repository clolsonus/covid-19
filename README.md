# Daily plots

## May 9, 2020

USA continues to trend down, but only by the slightest amounts.

## May 10, 2020

Today is mothers day in the USA.

## May 8, 2020

For the USA, we stay flat, but trending down very slightly.

## May 7, 2020

For the USA, we continue pretty flat on a pace around 2000 deaths per
day.  100k mark still looming out there on about May 20.

## May 6, 2020

Not much new today, the 100k mark for the USA slips back one day to
May 20, but the linear pace continues with no clear trend away from
that.  Professional model estimates have been pushing upwards (a lot)
in the past few days,finally acknowledging the USA as a whole is not
on a rapid down trajetory and no near term end in site.

## May 5, 2020

UK passes Italy.  Most of the big European countries are coming in
below the linear prediction, possibly moving towards a logistic
function being a better fit.  Brazil numbers are taking off.  US pace
might be dropping slightly, but only slightly ... or this could be a
weekend ebb in reporting.

## May 4, 2020

The past two days have been down (yeah!)  Let's hope the trend
continues and breaks the linear fit!  The 100k mark is looming out
there around May 20 at the current rate.

## May 3, 2020

A noticable dip in the data for today.

## Apr 26, 2020

Notice on this day the model predicted the 80k mark would be reached
on May 9.  Scroll up to May 6 and see that the prediction and progress
has been spot on (plus/minus 1 day.)

## Sometime in early April (2020) the USA death toll became quite linear, and thus a linear fit/predictor became the best model of our behavior available for near term expecations (at least for the upcoming 7-14 days.)
