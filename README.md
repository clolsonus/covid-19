# Weekly Plots

## Mar 22, 2021

USA: 836 deaths/day (daily rate is plummetting, probably a combination
of vaccine effectiveness and back side of the 2nd wave.)  Passed 540k
total deaths. 550k deaths by April 3.

## Mar 15, 2021

USA: 1,285 deaths/day (9 days away from going below 1k/day?)  Passed
530k total deaths. 540k by Mar 18, 550k by Mar 28, 560k by Apr 12.

![poly](figures/20210315.png?raw=true "15 March, 2021")

## Mar 8, 2021

USA: 1,451 deaths/day.  Passed 520k total deaths. 530k deatsh by Mar
11, 540k by Mar 19, 550k by Mar 31.  Brazil will pass the 300k mark in
approximately 10 days.

![poly](figures/20210301.png?raw=true "3 March, 2021")

## Feb 22, 2021

USA: 1,727 deaths/day.  This is a huge drop in a week.  5 weeks ago
the daily rate was approx. 3,700/day and now it is closer to
1,700/day.  This also significantly changes the longer range
projection which is great news.  Passed 490k, and 500k total
deaths. 510k deatsh by Feb 28, 520k by Mar 9.

![poly](figures/20210222.png?raw=true "22 February, 2021")

## Feb 15, 2021

USA: 2,931 deaths/day (approx 5 weeks above 3k a day.)  Passed 470k,
and 480k total deaths. 490k by Feb 16, 500k by Feb 20, 510k by Feb 23,
520k by Feb 27, 530k by Mar 2, 540k by Mar 6, 550k by March 9.  Daily
death rate is edging down, but very slowly.  Expeting to see some
positive impact from vaccinations showing pretty soon in the stats.

![poly](figures/20210215.png?raw=true "15 February, 2021")

## Feb 8, 2021

USA: 3,110 deaths/day, passed 450k, and 460k total deaths. 470k by Feb
10, 480k by Feb 13, 490k by Feb 16, 500k by Feb 19.  550k by March 8?
Daily death rate remains above 3000/day but now the curve fit has
flipped and is trending down very slightly.

![poly](figures/20210208.png?raw=true "8 February, 2021")

## Feb 1, 2021

USA: 3,280 deaths/day, passed 430k, and 440k total deaths. 450k by Feb
3, 460k by Feb 6, 470k by Feb 9, 480k by Feb 12, 490k by Feb 15, 500k
by Feb 18.  550k by March 4?  Daily death rate remains above 3000/day
but seems to be diminishing even though the overall fit is still
curving upwards. We are somewhere near the peak deaths or just beyond,
but the numbers have been volatile.

![poly](figures/20210201.png?raw=true "1 February, 2021")

## Jan 25, 2021

USA: 3,577 deaths/day, passed 400k, 410k, and 420k total deaths. 430k
by Jan 27, 450k by Feb 2, 500k by Feb 14.  Daily death rate remains
above 3000/day.  It looks like we have reached a peak in new cases in
the first half of January, so we should be looking for a peak in
reported deaths in early February?

![poly](figures/20210125.png?raw=true "25 January, 2021")

## Jan 18, 2021

USA: 3,526 deaths/day, passed 380k and 390k. 400k by Jan 19, 420k by
Jan 24, 450k by Jan 31, 480k by Feb 7.  Daily death rate continues to
accelerate back upwards.  IMHE keeps pushing their estimate of the
peak back each time they update the model -- now waying we won't peak
out until end of January.  The daily average for the last 7 days is
still over 3200 deaths/day.  Assuming vaccines are starting to make
their way to the most at-risk demographics, how soon until this starts
to show up as an improvement in the death totals?  A few weeks?  A
month?

![poly](figures/20210118.png?raw=true "18 January, 2021")

## Jan 11, 2021

USA: 2,852 deaths/day, passed 360k and 370k. 380k by Jan 13, 390k by
Jan 16, 400k by Jan 20, 450k by Feb 5.  Daily death rate is
accelerating back upwards again.  The actual average for the last 7
days is 3,225/day.  What we have to look forward to know is the after
affects of the social spreading during the holidays.

![poly](figures/20210111.png?raw=true "11 January, 2021")

## Jan 4, 2021

USA: 2,487 deaths/day, passed 340k and 350k "on schedule" so to
speak. 360k by Jan 7, 370k by Jan 11, 380k by Jan 15, 390k by Jan 19,
400k by Jan 23.  These have been pushed back by a day or two as the
fit curve flattens.  Daily death rate actually has been around (very
roughly) 2500 for 3 weeks now.  It's still hard to say what affect the
Holidays had on data reporting.  There is a clear flattening of the
daily rate which usually is a signal that it will begin dropping next,
but this is the first Christmas we've been through with covid so we
have to probably wait at least a few more days to determine if it is a
trend or an artifact.  If I was to guess at this moment, I think it is
some of both.  I think we are definitely getting out of the
exponential growth phase of this wave.

![poly](figures/20210104.png?raw=true "04 January, 2021")

## Dec 28, 2020

USA: 2,761 deaths/day, passed 320k and 330k.  340k by Dec 29, 350k by
Jan 2 2021, 360k by Jan 5, 370k by Jan 9, 380k by Jan 12, 390k by Jan
15, 400k by Jan 18.  Daily death rate plunged (good news relative to
where we were at.)  It's hard to say what affect Christmas/Holidays
has on data reporting, so maybe we'll see this week if this is a data
anomaly or if we have passed the peak of this wave.

![poly](figures/20201228.png?raw=true "28 December, 2020")

## Dec 21, 2020

USA: 2,963 deaths/day, passed 310k, 320k by Dec 22, 330k by Dec 24,
340k by Dec 28, 350k by Dec 31, 360k by Jan 2 2021, 370k by Jan 5,
380k by Jan 8, 390k by Jan 10, 400k by Jan 13?  Daily death rate
continues to increase, but seeing signs we are getting past the
exponential growth at least.  There is historically a big
slowdown in data rporting over any holiday, so watch for that to skew
the results temporarily.

![poly](figures/20201221.png?raw=true "21 December, 2020")

## Dec 14, 2020

USA: 2,564 deaths/day, passed 290k *and* 300k, 310k by Dec 18, 320k by
Dec 21, 330k by Dec 25, 340k by Dec 28, 350k by Dec 31, 360k by Jan 3
2021, 370k by Jan 6, 380k by Jan 8, 390k by Jan 11 (400k by Jan 14,
2021?)  Daily death rate continues to accelerate upwards suggesting we
still have some ways to go before any peak. IMHE is predicting the
peak at the end of Dec, but their prediction keeps getting pushed back
as this wave is worse than anyone imagined.

![poly](figures/20201214.png?raw=true "14 December, 2020")

## Dec 7, 2020

USA: 2119 deaths/day, passed 270k *and* 280k, 290k by Dec 10, 300k by

Dec 30, 350k by Jan 2 2021, 360k by Jan 5, (400k by Jan 17, 2021?)
Daily death rate continues to accelerate upwards suggesting we still
have some ways to go before any peak.

![poly](figures/20201207.png?raw=true "7 December, 2020")

by Dec 12, 300k by Dec 17 2020, 310k by Dec 21.  (350k by Jan 6,
2021?)  Possibly signs the upward acceleration is slowing (or was that
just the Thanksgiving holiday with many report processors on a long
weekend?)

![poly](figures/20201130.png?raw=true "30 November, 2020")

Are we still on track to top off this current peak int a week or two?

![poly](figures/20201123.png?raw=true "23 November, 2020")

270k by Dec 4, 300k by Dec 24 2020.  (350k by Jan 21, 2021?)
Eyeballing past data and trends, I estimate we have another 2-3 weeks
until the peak.  And then as this peak is tapering off, we will fuel
the next peak during the holidays and new years.

## Message - Oct 1, 2020

I started this project in part to counter a widespread disbelief in
covid and covid fatality numbers.  It was my attempt to add context
and show the future scary predictions were actually true, and largely
they have proven out over time, give or take a few days.  I think
we've now settled into an acceptance of the numbers (for better or
worse.)  There are still some that refuse to believe science and math,
and those people will always exist in some form.  I may scale back
updates to more of a weekly time schedule.  The scripts remain, and
the Johns Hopkins daily data feed is still live, for those that want
to explore their own data fitting parameters or run these scripts and
generate plots daily.

# Daily Plots

## Sept 30, 2020

September Summary:

* 190k deaths on 9/9
* 200k deaths on 9/22
* 23,335 deaths in September (778/day)

Looking ahead to October and beyond:

* At the current trajectory, we will hit 250k deaths in the USA by December 8.
* We could be above 260k deaths by the end of the year.
* Longer term models suggest the death rate will begin to climb again
  mid-late October.
* I am already seeing some upward pressure on the trajectory starting
  the last half of September.  We are still trending down, but less
  and less.  Meaning we are moving towards level and if that trend of
  trends continues we would eventually see daily deaths increasing
  again (as most models are predicting.)

## Sept 29, 2020

USA: Continued upward pressure in the daily death trends is bringing
the ETA to 250k deaths closer, now on/near Dec 10.  India will pass

The USA is on pace to reach 140k deaths by July 22, 150k by Aug 10.
The fit for USA suggests we a are still on a very slow downward trend,
but this is the week to keep watching.  The states reporting the most
deaths right now are many of the ones that were showing spikes in the
total number of cases in the past few weeks: IL, CA, TX, AZ, FL ...
Brazil on pace to reach 75k deaths in 10 days, still on a very flat

## July 4, 2020

USA has a light reporting day (possibly good news, or possibly due to
the 4th holiday.)  Sunday and Monday are typically low reporting days
as well, so expect artificially small numbers 3 days in a row (maybe?)
Brazil still flat and back to just over 1000 deaths/day. Mexico on
pace to pass Spain in 6 days.

![poly](figures/20200704.png?raw=true "4 July, 2020")

## July 3, 2020

USA death rate still on the cusp of switching to an upward trend.
Yesterday's fit rate: 653, today: 656 (even though the over all 35 day
fit trend is slightly down, 28 day fit is still up.)  Good chance of
reaching 130k deaths on the 4th.  The 140k mark bumps up yet another
day to July 20.  150k around Aug 7 (maybe sooner if the upwards trend
continues.)  Mexico should pass France in total deaths tomorrow.
Brazil's daily rate dips below 1000.

![poly](figures/20200703.png?raw=true "3 July, 2020")

## July 2, 2020

For the USA, as our death rate continues to flatten (or even start to
rise), we may reach the 130k mark closer to the 4th of July.  (This
could get pushed back to the 5th if reporting rates slow over the
holiday weekend.) We'll see 140k sooner by 1 day, now on July 21.
Brazil is on pace to reach 70k in 9 days.  India will reach 20k deaths
in 3 days.

![poly](figures/20200702.png?raw=true "2 July, 2020")

## July 1, 2020

The 28 day fit shows USA death rates starting to rise, but the 35 day
fit still shows a slight decline.  The USA 140k mark comes into view
near July 22. We are on the cusp of going the wrong way with
deaths/day I believe.  Mexico will pass France in total deaths in 2
days and Italy in 8 days.

![poly](figures/20200701.png?raw=true "1 July, 2020")

## June 30, 2020

USA 130k mark bumped closer one more day to July 5.  USA shows signs
of a leveling death rate (models predicted this and also that the
death rate will rise somewhat in July->Aug.)  Tomorrow, Brazil will

## June 27, 2020

The USA 130k mark is bumped closer by two days to near July 7.  This
is due in part to the NJ data revision, and possibly a leveling out of the
death rate. The USA daily death rate is revised back up to 606/day.

Mexico will pass France and Spain in total deaths in about 4 days.

India, Mexico, and Brazil all now have daily death rates higher than
the USA.  Brazil's rate continues flat (largely unchanged).  Mexico

fast as the fit line predicts.

## June 21, 2020

Note: I found a small issue with the reported current daily rate.  The
past numbers reported were the estimate for the next day, not the
current day ... sort of you classic off-by-one issue.  This is fixed
today and in future plots.

USA's daily rate continues to drop (551/day) but Sun/Mon are usually
lightly reported days so the true trend will be more clear Tuesday and
later in the week.  India and Mexico continue to increase their rates.  Brazil is currently pretty flat.

USA will hit the 120k mark tomorrow on the 21st.  India (568/day),
Mexico (627/day), and Brazil (1033/day) are all running at higher

USA's deaths per day continues to edge down a little lower than models

The USA 120k mark is bumped up another day to June 22.  Brazil
continues to be above 1000/day, but the trajectory is flattening.
Perhaps they are approaching the peak of their first wave.  Models are
predicting that the USA death rate will flatten or bump up slightly in
late June into July/Aug, but so far the rate is slowly dropping each
day.

days.  Brazil and Mexico still accelerating upwards.

![poly](figures/20200527.png?raw=true "27 May, 2020")

## May 26, 2020

The USA has a couple of light days pushing the trend line lower than
expected.  If you look at the data there is a weekly ebb and flow, but
the overall trend changes slowly.  Visually the fit line is still a
good match with the data points.  USA daily death rate (based on the
fit line) finally drops below 1000/day.  Brazil is now solidly above
1000/day and still accelerating.  Some future models suggest the USA
death rate will plateau again in June and begin to ramp up in July.
With everyone getting weary of social distancing and with memorial day
activities and summer here, this is not an implausible prediction.

Note on Spain's daily death rate in the plot.  It appears they have
revised their totals downward, and they were pretty level before that.
So the fit function actually is dropping.  This is an artifact in the
data and blindly fitting a polynomial to that data.  I'm just going to
let it roll on and over time the fit and estimates should correct
themselves.

## May 25, 2020

Changed to a 35 day fit and 21 day predict ahead to see how it looks.
Brazil's daily rate is almost even with the USA's.  Mexico passes Iran
in total deaths.  USA is realistically about a day and a half away
from 100k (May 27.)  Brazil is now about 5 days away from overtaking
France and Spain. and about 13 days from moving to 2nd place overall.
USA reaches 110k about June 7 (this target moved because of the change
in fit range from 28 to 35 days moved the fit line a bit.)  Both
Brazil and USA over 1000 deaths per day still.  The US is very slowly
declining, but Brazil is still accelerating.

## May 24, 2020

Brazil's daily rate just passed the USA's and is still accelerating.
Brazil is about 6 days away from overtaking France and Spain and about
14 days from moving to 2nd place overall.  Mexico passes Iran sometime
early tomorrow.  For the USA, the 100k mark pushed back to May 27,
110k on June 10.

## May 23, 2020

No major changes in the trends. 110k pushed back to June 9.

## May 22, 2020

USA fit/projection remains largely unchanged.  100k still on May 26.
110k around June 7.

Brazil and Mexico ... Brazil is really close to overtaking USA's
pace. :(

## May 21, 2020

USA fit/projection remains largely unchanged.  100k still on May 26.
110k around June 7.

Brazil hit 20k deaths a day earlier than predicted and is on pace to
move into 2nd overall place in about 16 days.

Mexico on pace to pass Iran in total deaths by May 24.

## May 20, 2020

USA fit/projection remains largely unchanged.  100k on May 26.  110k near
June 6.

Brazil is on pace to pass 20k deaths by May 22 and their rates are
accelerating and will soon be at a faster rate than the US.

![poly](figures/20200520.png?raw=true "20 May, 2020")

## May 19, 2020

Replaced Belgium (few new deaths) with Mexico (accelerating upwards.)
Mexico is on pace to exceed Iran's total number of deaths within a
week.

USA continues to it's glacial slowdown.

Looking off the end of the plot, Brazil is roughly on pace to pass all
countries other than the USA in 20 days (before mid-June.)  Wouldn't
it be a sad irony if the two of the countries with leaders that took
covid-19 the least seriously, ended up with the most deaths?

## May 18, 2020

Daily rate continues to drop in the USA, now close to 1300/day.  100k
mark is pushed back to May 26. Brazil will hit the 20k mark near May
21.

Notice that Brazil is still accelerating the wrong way (and they have
a president that really doesn't think covid is a big deal.)

USA continues to trend down, but only by the slightest amounts.  The 100k
mark shows up around May 24.

## May 8, 2020

For the USA, we stay flat, the 2nd order polynomial continues to be a
good fit to the existing data.

![poly](figures/20200508.png?raw=true "8 May, 2020")

## May 7, 2020

For the USA, we continue pretty flat on a pace around 1700 deaths per
day.

## May 6, 2020

The big change for today is a switch from a linear fit model to a 2nd
degree polynomial fit.  We have to be extremely careful extrapolating
with polynomials, but the curve is flat enough over the fit time span
that it actually works very well.  I believe for this time period the
predictive results are better than a logistic function.

Note this new fit pushes the 100k mark out beyond the end of the
graph.  Professional model estimates have been pushing upwards (a lot)
in the past few days,finally acknowledging the USA as a whole is not
on a rapid down trajectory and no near term end is in site.

## May 5, 2020

UK passes Italy.  Most of the big European countries are coming in
below the linear prediction, possibly moving towards a logistic
function being a better fit.  Brazil numbers are taking off.  US pace
might be dropping slightly, but only slightly ... or this could be a
weekend ebb in reporting.

## May 4, 2020

The past two days have been down (yeah!)  Let's hope the trend
continues and breaks the linear fit!  The 100k mark is looming out
there around May 20 at the current rate.

Notice on this day the model predicted the 80k mark would be reached
on May 9.  Scroll up to May 6 and see that the prediction and progress
has been spot on (plus/minus 1 day.)

![linear](figures/20200426.png?raw=true "26 Apr, 2020")

## Sometime in early April (2020) the USA death toll became quite linear, and thus a linear fit/predictor became the best model of our behavior available for near term expectations (at least for the upcoming 7-14 days.)
