## June 30, 2020

USA 130k mark bumped closer one more day to July 5.  USA shows signs
of a leveling death rate (models predicted this and also that the
death rate will rise somewhat in July->Aug.)  Tomorrow, Brazil will
hit 60k deaths and Mexico will pass Spain in total deaths.

![poly](figures/20200630.png?raw=true "30 June, 2020")

## June 29, 2020

USA 130k mark bumped closer one day to July 6.  Brazil on pace to hit
60k deaths in 2 days, 70k in 11 days, 80k in 20 days.  Mexico on pace
to pass Spain in total deaths in 2 days, France in 3 days, Italy in 9
days.  India will hit the 20k mark in about 5 days.

![poly](figures/20200628.png?raw=true "28 June, 2020")

## June 27, 2020

The USA 130k mark is bumped closer by two days to near July 7.  This
is due in part to the NJ data revision, and possibly a leveling out of the
death rate. The USA daily death rate is revised back up to 606/day.

Mexico will pass France and Spain in total deaths in about 4 days.

![poly](figures/20200627.png?raw=true "27 June, 2020")

## June 26, 2020

The USA passes the 125k mark and is on pace for 130k around July 9.
(The prediction/fit is changing quite a bit right now due to the
discontinuity in data introduced by New Jersey's data revisions.)
Mexico will pass France and Spain in total deaths in about 4 days.

![poly](figures/20200626.png?raw=true "26 June, 2020")

## June 25, 2020

Big jump is USA deaths today (probably as cases are reviewed?)  Brazil
will hit 60k deaths in 5 days.  Predicting the USA hits the 130k mark
on July 12.

![poly](figures/20200623.png?raw=true "23 June, 2020")

## June 22, 2020

India, Mexico, and Brazil all now have daily death rates higher than
the USA.  Brazil's rate continues flat (largely unchanged).  Mexico
and India are increasing. The USA is slowly decreasing, but not as
fast as the fit line predicts.

![poly](figures/20200622.png?raw=true "22 June, 2020")

## June 21, 2020

Note: I found a small issue with the reported current daily rate.  The
past numbers reported were the estimate for the next day, not the
current day ... sort of you classic off-by-one issue.  This is fixed
today and in future plots.

USA's daily rate continues to drop (551/day) but Sun/Mon are usually
lightly reported days so the true trend will be more clear Tuesday and
later in the week.  India and Mexico continue to increase their rates.  Brazil is currently pretty flat.

![poly](figures/20200621.png?raw=true "21 June, 2020")

## June 20, 2020

USA will hit the 120k mark tomorrow on the 21st.  India (568/day),
Mexico (627/day), and Brazil (1033/day) are all running at higher
daily rates than the USA now (549/day).  Brazil will hit the 50k mark
tomorrow, and the 60k mark in 10 days.

![poly](figures/20200620.png?raw=true "20 June, 2020")

## June 19, 2020

USA's deaths per day continues to edge down a little lower than models
predict, but still well above 500/day.  Brazil, Mexico, and India
still on very concerning tracks (other countries too, but these are
the ones I've chosen to plot for now.)

![poly](figures/20200619.png?raw=true "19 June, 2020")

## June 18, 2020

India is on pace to reach 20k deaths in 14 days, Mexico is on pace to
hit 20k deaths tomorrow.  Brazil will reach 50k in 3 days and 60k in
12 days.

![poly](figures/20200618.png?raw=true "18 June, 2020")

## June 17, 2020

Mexico is on pace to hit 20k deaths in 2 days.  The USA daily death
rate seems to be leveling out at just under 600/day.

![poly](figures/20200617.png?raw=true "17 June, 2020")

## June 16, 2020

The USA 120k mark is bumped up another day to June 22.  Brazil
continues to be above 1000/day, but the trajectory is flattening.
Perhaps they are approaching the peak of their first wave.  Models are
predicting that the USA death rate will flatten or bump up slightly in
late June into July/Aug, but so far the rate is slowly dropping each
day.

![poly](figures/20200616.png?raw=true "16 June, 2020")

## June 15, 2020

Mexico's daily death rate (604) is now higher than the USA's (590.)
Brazil continues to be above 1000 (1060/day.)

![poly](figures/20200615.png?raw=true "15 June, 2020")

## June 14, 2020

Brazil is still over 1000 deaths/day, 50k mark in 6 days, 60k mark in
15 days.  USA pace continues to diminish slowly, now just under
600/day.  USA 120k mark bumped up another day to June 23 (continuing
to suggest the USA pace is flattening.)  Mexico will hit the 20k mark
in 4 days.

![poly](figures/20200614.png?raw=true "14 June, 2020")

## June 13, 2020

Mexico will hit the 20k death mark in 5 days.  Brazil is still over
1000 deaths / day.  USA pace continues to diminish, but rate is
slowing.  120k mark bumped down again to June 24.

![poly](figures/20200613.png?raw=true "13 June, 2020")

## June 12, 2020

Brazil officially passes the UK and is now it 2nd place overall for
total deaths.  Still on a pace of over 1000 deaths per day.  USA's
120k prediction bumped up to June 25.

![poly](figures/20200612.png?raw=true "12 June, 2020")

## June 11, 2020

Removed Iran which is not seeing many new deaths and replaced with
India (316/day).  Brazil (1055/day) passed the 40k mark and will
overtake the UK for 2nd place in total deaths today.

![poly](figures/20200611.png?raw=true "11 June, 2020")

## June 10, 2020

Overall trends unchanged.  USA reaches the 128k mark by June 28.

![poly](figures/20200610.png?raw=true "10 June, 2020")

## June 9, 2020

Brazil is still running over 1000 deaths per day and is on pace to hit
the 40k mark in 2 days, overtakes the UK for 2nd place overall on
about June 13.  USA on pace to hit 120k in about 15 days.

![poly](figures/20200609.png?raw=true "9 June, 2020")

## June 8, 2020

Brazil is still on pace to overtake the UK in about 5 days.

![poly](figures/20200608.png?raw=true "8 June, 2020")

## June 7, 2020

The 120k mark is still out beyond the 14-day look ahead.  Mexico and
Brazil are still accelerating upwards.

![poly](figures/20200607.png?raw=true "7 June, 2020")

## June 6, 2020

The USA officially passed the 110k mark today in back-corrected data.
Brazil's data for yesterday was corrected and is on pace to pass the
UK in about 6 days.  Mexico and Brazil are still accelerating upwards.

![poly](figures/20200606.png?raw=true "6 June, 2020")

## June 5, 2020

Brazil's data was back corrected later so this comment has been
updated.  USA will probably pass 110k late June 6 or early June 7.

![poly](figures/20200605.png?raw=true "5 June, 2020")

## June 4, 2020

Trends continue without too much change.  USA 110k mark around June 8
(moved up 2 days from the prediction a few days ago.).  Brazil passes
Italy and is now 3rd place overall for deaths.

![poly](figures/20200604.png?raw=true "4 June, 2020")

## June 3, 2020

Trends continue without too much change.  USA 110k mark around June 9.
Brazil is one day from passing Italy and 7 days from passing the UK
for 2nd over all place in total deaths.

![poly](figures/20200603.png?raw=true "3 June, 2020")

## June 2, 2020

Trends continue without too much change.  USA 110k mark possibly
closer to June 9.

![poly](figures/20200602.png?raw=true "2 June, 2020")

## June 1, 2020

All the trajectories continue without too much change.  Sunday and
Monday evenings usually have the data coming in a bit lighter than the
rest of the week.

![poly](figures/20200601.png?raw=true "1 June, 2020")

## May 31, 2020

All the trajectories continue without too much change.  Sunday and
Monday evenings usually have the data coming in a bit lighter than the
rest of the week.

![poly](figures/20200531.png?raw=true "31 May, 2020")

## May 30, 2020

Brazil passes France in total deaths and is on pace to pass Italy in 4
days.  USA reaches 110k around June 10 still.

![poly](figures/20200530.png?raw=true "30 May, 2020")

## May 29, 2020

Brazil passes Spain in total deaths and is likely to pass France tomorrow.

![poly](figures/20200529.png?raw=true "29 May, 2020")

## May 28, 2020

Brazil is on pace to pass Spain tomorrow and France the next day.  The
USA seems to be consistently coming in slightly lower than the models
are predicting which is hopeful.

![poly](figures/20200528.png?raw=true "28 May, 2020")

## May 27, 2020

The USA passes 100k deaths today, estimating 110k by June 10.  Brazil
is on pace to pass France in 3 days and take over 2nd place in 11
days.  Brazil and Mexico still accelerating upwards.

![poly](figures/20200527.png?raw=true "27 May, 2020")

## May 26, 2020

The USA has a couple of light days pushing the trend line lower than
expected.  If you look at the data there is a weekly ebb and flow, but
the overall trend changes slowly.  Visually the fit line is still a
good match with the data points.  USA daily death rate (based on the
fit line) finally drops below 1000/day.  Brazil is now solidly above
1000/day and still accelerating.  Some future models suggest the USA
death rate will plateau again in June and begin to ramp up in July.
With everyone getting weary of social distancing and with memorial day
activities and summer here, this is not an implausible prediction.

Note on Spain's daily death rate in the plot.  It appears they have
revised their totals downward, and they were pretty level before that.
So the fit function actually is dropping.  This is an artifact in the
data and blindly fitting a polynomial to that data.  I'm just going to
let it roll on and over time the fit and estimates should correct
themselves.

![poly](figures/20200526.png?raw=true "26 May, 2020")

## May 25, 2020

Changed to a 35 day fit and 21 day predict ahead to see how it looks.
Brazil's daily rate is almost even with the USA's.  Mexico passes Iran
in total deaths.  USA is realistically about a day and a half away
from 100k (May 27.)  Brazil is now about 5 days away from overtaking
France and Spain. and about 13 days from moving to 2nd place overall.
USA reaches 110k about June 7 (this target moved because of the change
in fit range from 28 to 35 days moved the fit line a bit.)  Both
Brazil and USA over 1000 deaths per day still.  The US is very slowly
declining, but Brazil is still accelerating.

![poly](figures/20200525.png?raw=true "25 May, 2020")

## May 24, 2020

Brazil's daily rate just passed the USA's and is still accelerating.
Brazil is about 6 days away from overtaking France and Spain and about
14 days from moving to 2nd place overall.  Mexico passes Iran sometime
early tomorrow.  For the USA, the 100k mark pushed back to May 27,
110k on June 10.

![poly](figures/20200524.png?raw=true "24 May, 2020")

## May 23, 2020

No major changes in the trends. 110k pushed back to June 9.

![poly](figures/20200523.png?raw=true "23 May, 2020")

## May 22, 2020

USA fit/projection remains largely unchanged.  100k still on May 26.
110k around June 7.

Brazil and Mexico ... Brazil is really close to overtaking USA's
pace. :(

![poly](figures/20200522.png?raw=true "22 May, 2020")

## May 21, 2020

USA fit/projection remains largely unchanged.  100k still on May 26.
110k around June 7.

Brazil hit 20k deaths a day earlier than predicted and is on pace to
move into 2nd overall place in about 16 days.

Mexico on pace to pass Iran in total deaths by May 24.

![poly](figures/20200521.png?raw=true "21 May, 2020")

## May 20, 2020

USA fit/projection remains largely unchanged.  100k on May 26.  110k near
June 6.

Brazil is on pace to pass 20k deaths by May 22 and their rates are
accelerating and will soon be at a faster rate than the US.

![poly](figures/20200520.png?raw=true "20 May, 2020")

## May 19, 2020

Replaced Belgium (few new deaths) with Mexico (accelerating upwards.)
Mexico is on pace to exceed Iran's total number of deaths within a
week.

USA continues to it's glacial slowdown.

Looking off the end of the plot, Brazil is roughly on pace to pass all
countries other than the USA in 20 days (before mid-June.)  Wouldn't
it be a sad irony if the two of the countries with leaders that took
covid-19 the least seriously, ended up with the most deaths?

![poly](figures/20200519.png?raw=true "19 May, 2020")

## May 18, 2020

Daily rate continues to drop in the USA, now close to 1300/day.  100k
mark is pushed back to May 26. Brazil will hit the 20k mark near May
21.

## May 16, 2020

Notice that Brazil is still accelerating the wrong way (and they have
a president that really doesn't think covid is a big deal.)

![poly](figures/20200516.png?raw=true "16 May, 2020")

Today is mothers day in the USA.

![poly](figures/20200510.png?raw=true "10 May, 2020")

## May 9, 2020

USA continues to trend down, but only by the slightest amounts.  The 100k
mark shows up around May 24.

![poly](figures/20200509.png?raw=true "9 May, 2020")

## May 8, 2020

For the USA, we stay flat, the 2nd order polynomial continues to be a
good fit to the existing data.

![poly](figures/20200508.png?raw=true "8 May, 2020")

## May 7, 2020

For the USA, we continue pretty flat on a pace around 1700 deaths per
day.

![poly](figures/20200507.png?raw=true "7 May, 2020")

## May 6, 2020

The big change for today is a switch from a linear fit model to a 2nd
degree polynomial fit.  We have to be extremely careful extrapolating
with polynomials, but the curve is flat enough over the fit time span
that it actually works very well.  I believe for this time period the
predictive results are better than a logistic function.

Note this new fit pushes the 100k mark out beyond the end of the
graph.  Professional model estimates have been pushing upwards (a lot)
in the past few days,finally acknowledging the USA as a whole is not
on a rapid down trajectory and no near term end is in site.

![poly](figures/20200506.png?raw=true "6 May, 2020")

## May 5, 2020

UK passes Italy.  Most of the big European countries are coming in
below the linear prediction, possibly moving towards a logistic
function being a better fit.  Brazil numbers are taking off.  US pace
might be dropping slightly, but only slightly ... or this could be a
weekend ebb in reporting.

![linear](figures/20200505.png?raw=true "5 May, 2020")

## May 4, 2020

The past two days have been down (yeah!)  Let's hope the trend
continues and breaks the linear fit!  The 100k mark is looming out
there around May 20 at the current rate.

![linear](figures/20200504.png?raw=true "4 May, 2020")

## May 3, 2020

Notice on this day the model predicted the 80k mark would be reached
on May 9.  Scroll up to May 6 and see that the prediction and progress
has been spot on (plus/minus 1 day.)

![linear](figures/20200426.png?raw=true "26 Apr, 2020")

## Sometime in early April (2020) the USA death toll became quite linear, and thus a linear fit/predictor became the best model of our behavior available for near term expectations (at least for the upcoming 7-14 days.)
